## Introduction

Object tracking is an essential task in computer vision, enabling machines to detect and follow objects in videos or image sequences. Various algorithms have been developed over the years, each with its strengths and limitations. This repository aims to gather a collection of popular and state-of-the-art object tracking algorithms, providing a centralized resource for researchers and developers.

## Algorithms

The repository currently includes the following object tracking algorithms:

1. **Correlation Filters**
   - MOSSE (Minimum Output Sum of Squared Errors)
   - CSRT (Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracking)

2. **Deep Learning-based**
   - DeepSORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric)
   - SiamRPN (Siamese RPN)
   - SiamMask (Siamese Mask)
   - DaSiamRPN (Deeper and Stronger Siamese Networks for Real-Time Visual Tracking)

3. **Optical Flow-based**
   - Lucas-Kanade Tracker
   - Dense Optical Flow Tracker

4. **Multi-Object Tracking**
   - SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracker)
   - IOU Tracker (Intersection over Union Tracker)
   - Tracktor (Learning to Track: Online Multi-Object Tracking with Single and Multiple Cameras)

Note: This is not an exhaustive list, and the repository will be regularly updated with new algorithms and improvements.
